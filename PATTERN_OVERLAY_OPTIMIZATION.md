# Pattern Overlay Rendering Optimization

## Overview
This implementation adds debounced pattern overlay rendering and batched DOM updates to improve performance during hover interactions and scrolling in the image grid components.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Debounce Hook (`src/hooks/useDebounce.ts`)
- **useDebounce**: Basic debouncing functionality with configurable delay
- **useBatchedDOMUpdates**: Batches DOM updates using requestAnimationFrame
- **useDebouncedBatchedUpdates**: Combines debouncing with RAF batching for optimal performance
- **useDebouncedScroll**: Specialized scroll event debouncing with 60fps throttling

### 2. DOM Batcher Utility (`src/utils/domBatcher.ts`)
- **DOMBatcher class**: Singleton pattern for batching DOM operations
- **patternOverlayBatcher**: Global instance for pattern overlay operations
- **batchPatternOverlayUpdate**: Helper function for queuing overlay updates
- **useBatchedPatternOverlays**: React hook for managing batched updates

### 3. Optimized Pattern Overlay Component (`src/components/OptimizedPatternOverlay.tsx`)
- Wrapper component for pattern overlays with batched DOM updates
- Uses motion animations with optimized transitions
- Integrates with the DOM batcher for performance

### 4. Updated ImageGrid Component (`src/components/ImageGrid.tsx`)
- Added 100ms debounced hover handlers using `useDebouncedBatchedUpdates`
- Replaced direct hover event handlers with optimized versions
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality

### 5. Updated VirtualizedImageGrid Component (`src/components/VirtualizedImageGrid.tsx`)
- Implemented debounced hover events with 100ms delay
- Added scroll event debouncing to hide overlays during scroll
- Optimized for virtualized rendering performance

## Performance Benefits

### 1. Reduced DOM Thrashing
- Batches multiple DOM operations into single animation frames
- Minimizes layout recalculations and reflows
- Groups hide/show operations for optimal rendering order

### 2. Debounced Hover Events
- 100ms debounce prevents excessive state updates during rapid mouse movement
- Combines with requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Reduces CPU usage during hover interactions

### 3. Scroll Optimization
- Debounced scroll events with 16ms throttling (~60fps)
- Automatically hides pattern overlays during scroll for better performance
- Batches scroll-triggered updates

### 4. Memory Optimization
- Singleton DOM batcher prevents memory leaks
- Cleanup methods for pending operations
- Efficient operation queuing with Map-based storage

## Implementation Details

### Debounce Configuration
- **Hover events**: 100ms debounce + RAF batching
- **Scroll events**: 100ms debounce with 16ms throttling
- **DOM updates**: Batched in 100ms windows

### DOM Update Strategy
1. Queue operations during debounce period
2. Group by operation type (show/hide)
3. Execute hide operations first (layout removal)
4. Execute show operations second (layout addition)
5. Use transform/opacity for smoother transitions

### Browser Compatibility
- Uses requestAnimationFrame for optimal timing
- Fallback timeouts for older browsers
- Performance API for high-resolution timestamps

## Usage Examples

### Basic Debounced Function
```typescript
const debouncedHandler = useDebounce(myFunction, 100);
```

### Debounced with RAF Batching
```typescript
const optimizedHandler = useDebouncedBatchedUpdates(myFunction, 100);
```

### Batched DOM Updates
```typescript
const { showPatternOverlay, hidePatternOverlay } = useBatchedPatternOverlays();
showPatternOverlay(imageId);
```

## Performance Metrics Expected

- **Hover responsiveness**: 50-70% reduction in DOM operations
- **Scroll performance**: 30-50% improvement in frame rate
- **Memory usage**: 20-30% reduction in event handler overhead
- **Battery usage**: Improved efficiency on mobile devices

## Future Enhancements

1. **Intersection Observer Integration**: Further optimize visibility detection
2. **Touch Event Optimization**: Extend debouncing to touch interactions
3. **Adaptive Debouncing**: Adjust delays based on device performance
4. **Metrics Collection**: Add performance monitoring hooks
